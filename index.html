                I wrote this poem when during a period when I hit rock-bottom. I hope who ever's eyes this finds may find comfort.

            <h2>KEEP GOD FIRST</h2>
            <p>
Above all else,I'll KEEP GOD FIRST. 
I will not love so hard that I forget to love myself. 
I'll keep my friends but I'll be wise and guard my heart.
Because loyalty without truth is how I end up bleeding for people who never planned to stay.


                
I've learned that some hands only reach for me when they are empty. 
And some smiles only shine when I'm losing
I've learned that presence doesn't always mean peace, and silence can be the loudest kind of goodbye.
I've learned that not everyone who prays with me, prays for me.
And not everyone who calls me friend would still stand beside me if the world called me guilty so I'll KEEP GOD FIRST.
Because when the aplaud fades and the crowd leave, He is still the only one who claps for my survival. 


                
I've learned that I can love, but I will not lose myself trying to prove it.
Sometimes the one your fighting for is the same one handing out weapons behind your back.
Sometimes peace means walking away.


                
I will not let the world harden me
I'll let it teach me
I'll let heartbreak teach me boundaries and betrayal teach me clarity, but let God teach me how to heal.


                
When I pray, I won't just ask for blessings, 
I'll ask for wisdom
I'll ask for eyes that see through intentions,
Ears that hear what silence hides 
And a heart that forgives without returning to fire.


                
Above all else, I'll KEEP GOD FIRST. 
I'll keep my spirit clean and my heart guarded but not locked.
I'll keep my faith steady, my head high
And my circle small.


                
I want grace to carry my words when I speak.
I've leaned that sometimes the loudest form of faith is silence. 
The loudest form of faith is still trusting in God.


                
Above all else, I'LL KEEP GOD FIRST 
I'll always remember that it is not my job to be perfect, it is my job to be faithful and the rest, GOD WILL HANDLE.
